class Efl.Ui.Model_Homogeneous extends Efl.Ui.Model_Size
{
   [[Class to be used to store object item size for List/Grid View.

   This model provides the properties "$item.width" and "$item.height" which have the
   same value for all siblings of this object. The first sibling that defines "$self.width"
   and "$self.height" set them for all other siblings and also set "$item.width" and
   "$item.height" for the parent (See @Efl.Ui.Model_Size).

   Subsequent attempts to set "$self.width" or "$self.height" will fail with a
   Read Only error code.

   The properties "$total.width" and "$total.height" are computed from the number of node,
   the "$self.width" and "$self.height" assuming that the View is a vertical list.]]
